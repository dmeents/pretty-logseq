# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

Only the latest release is supported with security fixes. As a pre-1.0 project,
there are no legacy branches to maintain.

## Scope

Pretty Logseq is a client-side Logseq plugin. It runs inside Logseq's plugin
sandbox and has access to:

- The Logseq Editor API (read/write access to your graph)
- DOM manipulation within the Logseq UI
- No network access, no filesystem access, no external services

### In-scope vulnerabilities

- **DOM injection / XSS**: Unsanitized property values rendered into popovers or
  injected styles that could execute arbitrary code
- **Data exfiltration**: Any path where graph data could leak outside the plugin
  sandbox
- **Denial of service**: Input that causes the plugin to hang or crash Logseq
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Known CVEs in direct dependencies that are
  exploitable in this context

### Out-of-scope

- Vulnerabilities in Logseq itself or the Logseq Plugin API
- Issues requiring physical access to the user's machine
- Social engineering attacks
